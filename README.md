## Why I Built This Boilerplate?

**I created this React boilerplate to make it easier for myself (and others) to start new projects without having to set everything up from scratch. My goal was to build something that offers good performance and SEO optimizations, even though I’m continually working to improve it. By incorporating static implementations, this setup aims to provide a solid starting point for building production-ready applications that can scale as needed.**
